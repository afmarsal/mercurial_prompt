		MERCURIAL PROMPT

This set of scripts will show mercurial repository information in 
your bash prompt

FEATURES
* Shows branch name, incoming and outgoing changesets, and working directory "dirtyness" (whether
there's pending changes to commit)
* Prompt color depending on the current host
* Requires the a working keyring extension!! (password is not asked when a remote repository is 
accessed)

FILES
* retrieve_repos_info.sh - gathers info for the monitored repos, and writes it to tmp files.
* update_prompt.sh - updates the prompt reading the tmp files previously written. It launches
	the retrieve_repos_info.sh script in the background
* README - this file

HOW TO INSTALL
1) Save all files in a directory of your choice

2) Configure:
2.1) Edit update_prompt.sh file and add the directories you want to monitor to the MP_BRANCH_PATHS
list.
2.2) Set the name in MP_HOSTNAME of your hosted vm
2.3) Set the refresh interval for the repositories (MP_SLEEP_BETWEEN_REFRESHES). For testing, you
can set this to 1, until you make sure that this package works for you

3) Source update_prompt.sh into your current bash shell (this will also launch the retrieve_repos_info.sh
in the background)
$ source <install_dir>/update_prompt.sh
Tip: You can add it to your .bashrc

4) Go to a monitored directory and behold your new prompt!!! :)
You should see something like this:

afernandez@local:~/src_tree [...user-video-chat: 4i/2o *]$

TROUBLESHOOTING
You can try to start retrieve_repos_info.sh in debug mode specifying the "-d" flag

HOW IT WORKS
There are two scripts in this package:
* retrieve_repos_info.sh: it runs an infinite loop, checking the monitored folders for mercurial info.
It writes this info to a file, which will be read by the other script. If the remote repository is not
available, a question mark (?) will be shown
* update_prompt.sh: it configures the bash prompt to execute a function. If current directory matches
one of the monitored folders (or subfolder), mercurial information regarding the repository will be shown.
To show this info, the file written by the previous script will be read. If there's no info available or the
information is outdated, a question mark will be shown. 

TO-DO
* implement "--only-colors" command line option
* Make colors configurable (themes)
* Make prompt configurable
* If password is asked in normal mode, this script won't work
